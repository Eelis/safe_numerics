<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Almost. Replacing all built-in types with their safe
        counterparts should result in a program that will compile and run as
        expected. In some cases compile time errors will occur and adjustments
        to the source code will be required. Typically these will result in
        code which is more correct. See <a class="link" href="safe.html#safe_numerics.drop_in_replacement" title="As a Drop-in replacement for standard integer types.">drop-in

<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Actually, I believe that this can/should be applied to any type
        T which satisfies the type requirement "Numeric" type as defined in
        the documentation. So there should be specializations
        safe&lt;float&gt; et. al. and eventually safe&lt;fixed_decimal&gt;
        etc. But the current version of the library only addresses integer
        types. Hopefully the library will evolve to match the promise implied

<tr class="answer">
<td align="left" valign="top"></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>The guiding purpose of the library is to trap incorrect
        arithmetic behavior - not just undefined behavior. Although a savvy
        user may understand and keep present in his mind that an unsigned
        integer is really modular type, the plain reading of an arithmetic
        expression conveys the idea that all operands are plain integers. Also
        in many cases, unsigned integers are used in cases where modular
        arithmetic is not intended, such as array indexes. Finally, the
        modulus for such an integer would vary depending upon the machine
        architecture. For these reasons, in the context of this library, an
        unsigned integer is considered to a representation of a subset of
        integers which is expected to provide correct integer results. Note
        that this decision is consistent with INT30-C, &#8220;Ensure that unsigned
        integer operations do not wrap&#8221; in the CERT C Secure Coding Standard
        [Seacord 2008]..</p></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>THe original version of the library used C++11. Feedback from
        CPPCon, <a href="www.blincubator.com" target="_top">Boost Library
        Incubator</a> and Boost developer's mailing list convinced me that
        I had to address the issue of run-time penalty much more seriously. I
        resolved to eliminate or minimize it. This led to more elaborate
        meta-programming. But this wasn't enough. It became apparent that the
        only way to really minimize run-time penalty was to implement
        compile-time integer range arithmetic - a pretty elaborate sub
        library. By doing range arithmetic at compiler-time, I could skip
        runtime checking on many/most integer operations. C++11 constexpr
        wasn't quite enough to do the job. C++14 constexpr can do the job. The
        library currently relies very heavily on C++14 constexpr. I think that
        those who delve into the library will be very surprised at the extent
        that minor changes in user code can produce guaranteed correct integer
        code with zero run-time penalty. </p></td>
