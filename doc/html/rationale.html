<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Almost. Replacing all built-in types with their safe
          counterparts should result in a program that will compile and run as
          expected. In some cases compile time errors will occur and
          adjustments to the source code will be required. Typically these
          will result in code which is more correct. See <a class="link" href="safe.html#safe_numerics.drop_in_replacement" title="As a Drop-in replacement for standard integer types.">drop-in

<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Actually, I believe that this can/should be applied to any
          type T which satisfies the type requirement "Numeric" type as
          defined in the documentation. So there should be specializations
          safe&lt;float&gt; et. al. and eventually safe&lt;fixed_decimal&gt;
          etc. But the current version of the library only addresses integer
          types. Hopefully the library will evolve to match the promise
          implied by it's name.</p></td>

<tr class="answer">
<td align="left" valign="top"></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>The guiding purpose of the library is to trap incorrect
          arithmetic behavior - not just undefined behavior. Although a savvy
          user may understand and keep present in his mind that an unsigned
          integer is really modular type, the plain reading of an arithmetic
          expression conveys the idea that all operands are plain integers.
          Also in many cases, unsigned integers are used in cases where
          modular arithmetic is not intended, such as array indexes. Finally,
          the modulus for such an integer would vary depending upon the
          machine architecture. For these reasons, in the context of this
          library, an unsigned integer is considered to a representation of a
          subset of integers which is expected to provide correct integer
          results. Note that this decision is consistent with INT30-C, &#8220;Ensure
          that unsigned integer operations do not wrap&#8221; in the CERT C Secure
          Coding Standard [Seacord 2008]..</p></td>
