  <title>Background</title>

  <para>This library is a re-implementation of the facilities provided by
  <ulink url="http://safeint.codeplex.com">David LeBlanc's SafeInt
  Library</ulink> using C++14 and the <ulink url="www.boost.org">Boost
  Libraries</ulink>. I found this library very well done in every way. My main
  usage was to run unit tests for my embedded systems projects on my PC.
  Still, I had a few issues.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>It was a lot of code in one header - 6400 lines. Very unwieldy to
      understand, modify and maintain.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>I couldn't find separate documentation other than that in the
      header file.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>It didn't use <ulink url="www.boost.org">Boost</ulink> conventions
      for naming.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>It required porting to different compilers.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>It had a very long license associated with it.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>I could find no test suite for the library.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>This version addresses these issues. It exploits <ulink
  url="www.boost.org">Boost</ulink> facilities such as template
  metaprogramming to reduce the number of lines of source code to
  approximately 4700. It exploits the Boost Preprocessor Library to generate
  exhaustive tests.</para>

  <para>All concepts, types and functions documented are declared in the name
  space <code>boost::numeric</code>.</para>
