  <section id="safe_numerics.introduction.problem">
    <title>Problem</title>

    <para>Arithmetic operations in C/C++ are NOT guaranteed to yield a correct
    mathematical result. This feature is inherited from the early days of C.
    The behavior of <code>int</code>, <code>unsigned int</code> and others
    were designed to map closely to the underlying hardware. Computer hardware
    implements these types as a fixed number of bits. When the result of
    arithmetic operations exceeds this number of bits, the result will not be
    arithmetically correct. The following example illustrates just one example
    where this causes problems.</para>

    <programlisting>int f(int x, int y){
    // this returns an invalid result for some legal values of x and y !
    return x + y;
}
</programlisting>

    <para>It is incumbent upon the C/C++ programmer to guarantee that this
    behavior does not result in incorrect or unexpected operation of the
    program. There are no language facilities which implement such a
    guarantee. A programmer needs to examine each expression individually to
    know that his program will not return an invalid result. There are a
    number of ways to do this. In the above instance,
    <citation>INT32-C</citation> seems to recommend the following
    approach:</para>

    <programlisting>int f(int x, int y){
  if (((y &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (x &gt; (INT_MAX - y))) 
  || ((y &lt; 0) &amp;&amp; (x &lt; (INT_MIN - y)))) {
    /* Handle error */
  }
  return x + y;
}
</programlisting>

    <para>This will indeed trap the error. However, it would be tedious and
    laborious for a programmer to alter his code to do so. Altering code in
    this way for all arithmetic operations would likely render the code
    unreadable and add another source of potential programming errors. This
    approach is clearly not functional when the expression is even a little
    more complex as is shown in the following example.</para>

    <programlisting>int f(int x, int y, int z){
    // this returns an invalid result for some legal values of x and y !
    return x + y * z;
}
</programlisting>

    <para>This example addresses only the problem of undefined/erroneous
    behavior related to overflow of the addition operation as applied to the
    type <code>int</code>. Similar problems occur with other built-in integer
    types such as <code>unsigned</code>, <code>long</code>, etc. And it also
    applies to other operations such as subtraction, multiplication etc. .
    C/C++ often automatically and silently converts some integer types to
    others in the course of implementing binary operations and similar
    problems occur in this case as well. Since the problems and their
    solutions are similar, we'll confine the current discussion to just this
    one example.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="safe_numerics.introduction.solution">
    <title>Solution</title>

    <para>This library implements special versions of <code>int</code>,
    <code>unsigned</code>, etc. which behave exactly like the original ones
    <emphasis role="bold">except</emphasis> that the results of these
    operations are guaranteed to be either to be arithmetically correct or to
    invoke an error. Using this library, the above example would be rendered
    as:</para>

    <programlisting>#include &lt;boost/safe_numerics/safe_integer.hpp&gt;
using namespace boost::numeric;
safe&lt;int&gt; f(safe&lt;int&gt; x, safe&lt;int&gt; y){
  return x + y; // throw exception if correct result cannot be returned
}
</programlisting>

    <para><note>
        <para>Library code in this document resides in the name space
        <code>boost::numeric</code>. This name space has generally been
        eliminated from text, code and examples in order to improve
        readability of the text.</para>
      </note>The addition expression is checked at runtime or (if possible) at
    compile time to trap any possible errors resulting in incorrect arithmetic
    behavior. This will permit one to write arithmetic expressions that cannot
    produce an erroneous result. Instead, one and only one of the following is
    guaranteed to occur.</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the expression will yield the correct mathematical
          result</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the expression will emit a compilation error.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the expression will invoke a runtime exception.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>In other words, the <emphasis role="bold">library absolutely
    guarantees that no arithmetic expression will yield incorrect
    results</emphasis>.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="safe_numerics.introduction.implementation">
    <title>How It Works</title>

    <para>The library implements special versions of <code>int</code>,
    <code>unsigned</code>, etc. named <code>safe&lt;int&gt;</code>,
    <code>safe&lt;unsigned int&gt;</code> etc. These behave exactly like the
    underlying types <emphasis role="bold">except</emphasis> that expressions
    using these types fulfill the above guarantee. These types are meant to be
    "drop-in" replacements for the built-in types they are meant to replace.
    So things which are legal - such as assignment of a <code>signed</code> to
    <code>unsigned</code> value - are not trapped at compile time as they are
    legal C/C++ code. Instead, they are checked at runtime to trap the case
    where this (legal) operation would lead to an arithmetically incorrect
    result.</para>

    <para>Note that the library addresses arithmetical errors generated by
    straightforward C/C++ expressions. Some of these arithmetic errors are
    defined as conforming to the C/C++ standards while others are not. So
    characterizing this library as addressing undefined behavior of C/C++
    numeric expressions would be misleading.</para>

    <para>Facilities particular to C++14 are employed to minimize any runtime
    overhead. In many cases there is no runtime overhead at all. In other
    cases, a program using the library can be slightly altered to achieve the
    above guarantee without any runtime overhead.</para>

    handling. In addition to the usage serving as a drop-in replacement for
    standard integer types, users of the library can:</para>

    <title>Scope</title>

    <para>This library currently applies only to built-in integer types.
    Analogous issues arise for floating point types but they are not currently
    addressed by this version of the library. User or library defined types
    such as arbitrary precision integers can also have this problem. Extension
    of this library to these other types is not currently under development
    but may be addressed in the future. This is one reason why the library
    name is "safe numeric" rather than "safe integer" library.</para>
